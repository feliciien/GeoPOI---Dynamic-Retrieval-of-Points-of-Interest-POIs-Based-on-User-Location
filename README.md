# GeoPOI - Dynamic Retrieval of Points of Interest (POIs) Based on User Location

## Description

GeoPOI is a project that demonstrates how to dynamically fetch Points of Interest (POIs) from OpenStreetMap based on the user's current location. It utilizes the openstreetmapGetPOIs function from the ez-opendata.js module to retrieve POIs within a certain radius around the user's location.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone
```

2. Open the index.html file in your web browser.

3. Ensure that your browser supports geolocation and allow the website to access your location when prompted.

4. The web page will display a list of POIs near your current location based on predefined categories (e.g., bars, cafes, restaurants).

## Usage

- Upon loading the web page, the browser will prompt you to allow access to your location. Grant permission to proceed.
- The page will then display a list of POIs near your current location based on predefined categories.
- Click on any POI to view more details or visit its OpenStreetMap page.

## Dependencies

This project relies on the ez-opendata.js module to fetch POIs from OpenStreetMap. Ensure that your internet connection is active to fetch the POIs.
